This is a simple RESTful API for a blog platform that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Users can also view all blog posts or a specific blog post by its ID. The API allows users to filter blog posts by category and sort by date created. The application is built using Node.js and the Express framework, and uses MongoDB to store the blog posts.
